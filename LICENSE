FRAMEWORK CONSTANTS (For Reference)
================================================================================

The KDFA framework uses three derived constants with zero free parameters:

- Critical coupling: kappa* = 1/e = 0.368
- Correlation dimension: D2 = 19/13 = 1.462
- Harmonic constant: N0 = 168e = 456

These constants and their derivations are part of this licensed work.
